# team-Blitz-Fly-High
This is the repo for the Game development event Milieu22held at Presidency University, Kolkata. We have all played the Fly High game in our childhood. Especially the 90's guys will be more familiar to it. This game is a basic feeling of the actual one Flappy bird.

Install the python Pygame package to make this game work(run) and enjoy like it like you used to in your childhood. For installing Pygame-- just type 'pip install pygame' in your terminal(cmd).
